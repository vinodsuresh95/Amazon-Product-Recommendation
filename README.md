# Amazon-Product-Recommendation

### Problem Statement
Online E-commerce websites like Amazon, Filpkart uses different recommendation models to provide different suggestions to different users. Build your own recommendation system for products on an e-commerce website like Amazon.com.

**Amazon** currently uses item-to-item collaborative filtering, which scales to massive data sets and produces high-quality recommendations in real time. This type of filtering matches each of the user's purchases and rated items to similar items, then combines those similar items into a recommendation list for the user.

In this project we are going to build recommendation model for the electronics products of Amazon. 
### Dataset
